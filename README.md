# Script-install-EFI-B360M-A_i3-9100F_RX580

There is a lot of work

[The main repository with files in EFI here](https://github.com/merelyigor/Asus-Prime-B360M-A_i3-9100F_RX580)

[Closed repo with a mine personal config](https://github.com/merelyigor/Asus-Prime-B360M-A_i3-9100F_RX580_config_plist) only for me

[Open repo with script for automatic delivery of EFI to disk](https://github.com/merelyigor/Script-install-EFI-B360M-A_i3-9100F_RX580)

Copy to terminal and press Enter
```
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/merelyigor/Script-install-EFI-B360M-A_i3-9100F_RX580/master/run.sh)"
```

## What kind of repo with custom config ???


## So how do make your own repo config.plist so that everything works smoothly ???
